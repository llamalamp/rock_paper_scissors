Rock paper scissors java project from 'The Odin Project'

This project is directly from theOdinProject.com Web Development 101 project: Rock Paper Scissors. 

The goal sounds like I'm creating a simple rock, paper, scissors game that runs from the console, no html output yet. 
Instructions go on to say that a later lesson will create a web page type input so to save it on github for later use. 

This project is in JS.
