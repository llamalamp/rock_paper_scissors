Rock paper scissors java project from 'The Odin Project'

This project is directly from theOdinProject.com Web Development 101 project: Rock Paper Scissors. 

The goal sounds like I'm creating a simple rock, paper, scissors game that runs from the console, no html output yet. 
Instructions go on to say that a later lesson will create a web page type input so to save it on github for later use. 

This project is in JS. 

FINAL NOTES:
Just like the first html/css project, this was another doozy! I struggled a lot trying to get the different functions to work together.
I'm still not sure how calling the functions at the end like function(words(words)) works or why or why not something goes in
the () after the function name like function funcOne (wtf goes here and why) {} ect. 

The loops were optional so i first tried to just call everything five time but couldn't get that right so ended up using a for loop
anyway. 

According to the documentation, we will re-visit this project later and make it more user friendly with a webpage style html/css stuff. 
im excited about it and also dreading it haha.
